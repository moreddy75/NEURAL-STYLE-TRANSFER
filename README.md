Task Description: Neural Style Transfer
Objective:
To implement a Neural Style Transfer (NST) model that applies the artistic style of one image (e.g., a famous painting) to the content of another image (e.g., a photograph), producing a visually blended output.

Problem Statement:
Traditional image filters lack artistic intelligence. Neural Style Transfer offers a deep learning solution to generate stylized visuals for creative applications such as photo editing, marketing, and visual content generation.

Approach:

Use a pre-trained VGG19 convolutional neural network from PyTorch as the feature extractor.

Extract content features from a photograph and style features from an artwork.

Compute a loss function that combines content loss and style loss.

Optimize the target image to minimize this loss using backpropagation.

Tools and Libraries:

Python

PyTorch

Torchvision

PIL (Python Imaging Library)

Matplotlib

Deliverable:
A Python script or Jupyter notebook that:

Loads content and style images

Applies style transfer

Displays and saves the stylized output image

Output:
A new image combining the structure of the content image with the artistic patterns of the style image.
